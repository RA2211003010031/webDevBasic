    So p is the selector and we write the syntax like 
    <h4>p {color : red;}</h4>
    &nbsp;here, color is the property <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red is the value
    <h5>Here, selector is basically the tag name or id name which you made in html code and property is what the property of element you want to change and at last the value is what value to place there.</h5>
    <hr>
    <br>
    So we can add multiple selectors using comma as seperator
    <br><h4>header, p.intro</h4>
    <br>So we write further the action block or declaration block as-
    <h4>header, p.intro <br> {<br> background-color : red <br>border-radius : 3px <br> ) </h4>
    <hr>
    <br>
    So there are three different ways to include css to markup.
    Markup is nothing but html code.
    <details>
        <summary>1. INLINE CSS</summary>
        In this, the css is directly added to the markup code. Like we were doing for the img, that's where the width and length i guess. 
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>2. INTERNAL CSS</summary>
        In this, the css is kept inside the head. The css code is written there without disturbing the body code of markup.
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>3. EXTERNAL CSS</summary>
        In this, the css is kept inside a .css file and is included in the markup. This is the best method to maintain the skeleton and style of website.
